&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> AI models, especially Large Language Models have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing by achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. However, their widespread adoption has also raised concerns about their vulnerabilities to various adversarial attacks. In this talk, I will introduce our recent efforts in exploring the robustness of current AI architectures for NLP and how to defend them against adversarial attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Speaker:&lt;/strong> Anh Tuan Luu (&lt;a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tuanluu.github.io/)&lt;/a>, the Assistant Professor at School of Computer Science and Engineering, NTU. Before that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL and a member of the NLP group under the supervision of Prof. Regina Barzilay from 2018 to 2020. He obtained Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from NTU in 2016. From 2016 to 2018, he was a research scientist at Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore in the Natural Language Processing group of Dr. Jian Su. His research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing with the focus on applications of pretrained language models, semantics, question &amp;amp; answering, information extraction and knowledge construction, robustness &amp;amp; trustworthy AI, and recommendation systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Talk title:&lt;/strong> Do LLMs Excel in Every Aspect? Overcoming Limitations through Scalable Learning&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> The advent of large-scale language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has revolutionized our understanding and capabilities. However, the challenges of hallucination, scalability, and adaptability remain. This talk presents three of our research efforts that address these challenges. First, I will discuss a framework to distill commonsense knowledge from large language models, enabling commonsense reasoning at scale. Second, I will introduce a general-purpose commonsense verification language model that surpasses the performance of its larger counterparts, thereby offering a more resource-efficient yet effective alternative. Finally, I will explore the concept of in-context adaptation learning for smaller-scale language models, demonstrating their ability to generalize across different domains on some typical NLP tasks. In the end, I will discuss remaining challenges and future research directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Speaker:&lt;/strong> Wenya Wang (&lt;a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wangwy/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wangwy/)&lt;/a>. She is an Assistant Professor with the school of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU. Prior to joining NTU, she worked with Noah Smith and Hanna Hajishirzi as a Postdoc in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. She completed my PhD under the supervision of Sinno Jialin Pan at NTU. Her main research interests lie in reasoning for Natural Language Processing (or multimodal learning), including logic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, knowledge integration etc.&lt;/p>

In data integration, the use of deep learning techniques has helped establish several state-of-the-art results in long standing problems, including information extraction, entity matching, data cleaning, and table understanding. In this talk, I will reflect on the strengths of deep learning and how that has helped move forward the needle in data integration. I will also discuss a few challenges associated with solutions based on deep learning techniques and describe some opportunities for future work.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for accessing parametric knowledge, but the potential of tapping into the vast expanse of external or private data remains largely unexplored. This talk presents an open-source question-answering system for seamlessly integrating model parameters with knowledge from external data sources to enhance its predictive capabilities. Our larger vision transcends question answering. We envision a personal insight assistant, adept at sifting through your past data to offer invaluable insights to help make informed decisions and plan with foresight.&lt;/p>
