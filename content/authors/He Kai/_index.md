Providing adequate medical care to everyone in the world remains a challenge, especially with many healthcare professionals already overworked. Training qualified doctors is a demanding task, and this contributes to the problem. One potential solution is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to alleviate the workload of medical workers. AI has the potential to play a crucial role in the entire healthcare process, from predicting diseases, recommending medication, and providing prognosis.

He Kai and his colleagues are dedicated to researching medical AI, with the goal of effectively reducing the current pressure on medical workers. By integrating AI into healthcare, we can improve patient outcomes, enhance efficiency, and ultimately provide better medical care to people around the world.
