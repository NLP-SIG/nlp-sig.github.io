I am a PhD student at National University of Singapore, advised by Asst. Prof. Anh-Tuan Luu and Prof. See-Kiong Ng. Currently, my research interests are Natural Language Processing, particularly Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization, and Machine Learning, specifically Representation Learning and Optimization.
