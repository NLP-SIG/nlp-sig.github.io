I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Assoc. Prof. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low. I received my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Data Science & Analytics and a minor in Computer Science from NUS in 2020. I am currently supported by the ISEP-IDS Scholarship jointly offered by the NUS Graduate School Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP) and the Institute of Data Science (IDS).
