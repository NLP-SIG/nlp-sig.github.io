I am a PhD student in NUS IDS&SoC work with Bryan Hooi, See Kiong Ng and Luu Anh Tuan(NTU). Meanwhile, I am visisting UCL WI group cooperating with Aldo Lipani and Emine Yilmaz. Previously, I worked as a R&D engineer in natural language processing working with Prof. Zhang Richong, affiliated with BDBC and Computer Science College in Beihang University. My current research interests lie in LLLM applications on task-oriented dialogue system, reasoning and calibration capability of LLM.
