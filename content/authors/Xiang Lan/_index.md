I am a Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of Prof. Feng Mengling. My research focuses on designing and applying machine learning algorithms that help to solve real-world healthcare problems. Before Ph.D., I graduated from NUS with a master’s degree in electrical & computer engineering and did my research intern at IBM Research. Before Master, I graduated from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) with a bachelor’s degree in electronic information science & technology.
