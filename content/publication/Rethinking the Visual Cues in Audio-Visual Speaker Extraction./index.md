abstract: The Audio-Visual Speaker Extraction (AVSE) algorithm employs parallel video recording to leverage two visual cues, namely speaker identity and synchronization, to enhance performance compared to audio-only algorithms. However, the visual front-end in AVSE is often derived from a pre-trained model or end-to-end trained, making it unclear which visual cue contributes more to the speaker extraction performance. This raises the question of how to better utilize visual cues. To address this issue, we propose two training strategies that decouple the learning of the two visual cues. Our experimental results demonstrate that both visual cues are useful, with the synchronization cue having a higher impact. We introduce a more explainable model, the Decoupled Audio-Visual Speaker Extraction (DAVSE) model, which leverages both visual cues.
