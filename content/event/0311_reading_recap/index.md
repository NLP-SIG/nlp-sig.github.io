We are delighted to share that our NLP SIG seminar on Large Language Models (LLMs), held on the 3rd of November, was a notable gathering, underscored by the presence of two luminaries in the field.

## Distinguished Speakers:

* **Anh Tuan Luu**: A venerated authority with a storied career from postdoctoral research at MIT to impactful roles in NLP at NTU and I2R, Luu is at the forefront of fortifying the robustness of AI systems.
* **Wenya Wang**: A trailblazing researcher whose postdoctoral work at the University of Washington has given rise to innovative methodologies for enhancing the scalability and reasoning capabilities of AI.

## Highlights from the Talks:

Anh Tuan Luu offered a deep dive into the resilience of AI models in NLP, spotlighting pioneering work in protecting AI infrastructures against adversarial encroachments to bolster their reliability and trustworthiness.
