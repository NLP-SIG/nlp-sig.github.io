We are pleased to announce that NUS IDS (Institute of Data Science) NLP-SIG Workshop for TheWebConf 2024 will be held on Friday, May 17. This work is for both students, practitioners and faculty working in AI, NLP and LLMs to network. We are further excited about the unique opportunity presented to Singapore on 13-17 May as TheWebConf 2024, a premier Web research conference, is being held in Singapore. Leveraging the attendance of many reputed academicians, we’re looking forward to hosting them as a part of this workshop – and, further, taking the opportunity to invite them to the Institute of Data Science of National University of Singapore (NUS) to engage with us. More details can be found on this [Link](https://nlp-sig.github.io/idsnlp-2024/)

The venue will be held at Innovation 4.0, 3 Research Link, Singapore 117602, [Map]. Please note our venues can only accommodate a limited seating capacity; in the event of oversubscription, we may offer online attendance to registered participants. So make early bird registration as quick as possible to secure seats.
