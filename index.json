He obtained Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from NTU in 2016. From 2016 to 2018, he was a research scientist at Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore in the Natural Language Processing group of Dr. Jian Su. His research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing with the focus on applications of pretrained language models, semantics, question \u0026amp; answering, information extraction and knowledge construction, robustness \u0026amp; trustworthy AI, and recommendation systems.\nTalk title: Do LLMs Excel in Every Aspect? Overcoming Limitations through Scalable Learning\nAbstract: The advent of large-scale language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has revolutionized our understanding and capabilities. However, the challenges of hallucination, scalability, and adaptability remain. This talk presents three of our research efforts that address these challenges. First, I will discuss a framework to distill commonsense knowledge from large language models, enabling commonsense reasoning at scale. Second, I will introduce a general-purpose commonsense verification language model that surpasses the performance of its larger counterparts, thereby offering a more resource-efficient yet effective alternative. Finally, I will explore the concept of in-context adaptation learning for smaller-scale language models, demonstrating their ability to generalize across different domains on some typical NLP tasks. In the end, I will discuss remaining challenges and future research directions.\nSpeaker: Wenya Wang (https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wangwy/).

In data integration, the use of deep learning techniques has helped establish several state-of-the-art results in long standing problems, including information extraction, entity matching, data cleaning, and table understanding. In this talk, I will reflect on the strengths of deep learning and how that has helped move forward the needle in data integration. I will also discuss a few challenges associated with solutions based on deep learning techniques and describe some opportunities for future work. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for accessing parametric knowledge, but the potential of tapping into the vast expanse of external or private data remains largely unexplored. This talk presents an open-source question-answering system for seamlessly integrating model parameters with knowledge from external data sources to enhance its predictive capabilities. Our larger vision transcends question answering.
